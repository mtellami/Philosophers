### ♦️  Topic
  - #### Thread ?</br>
  A thread in computer science is short for a thread of execution. Threads are a way for a program to divide (termed "split") itself into two or more simultaneously (or pseudo-simultaneously) running tasks. Threads and processes differ from one operating system to another but, in general, a thread is contained inside a process and different threads in the same process share same resources while different processes in the same multitasking operating system do not.
  - #### Multithreading ?</br>
  A thread is also known as lightweight process. The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads.
  - #### Process vs Thread? ?</br>
  The primary difference is that threads within the same process run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.
